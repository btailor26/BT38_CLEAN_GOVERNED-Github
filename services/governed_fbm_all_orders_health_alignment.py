"""Align FBM health to the same browser-session snapshot used by the workspace.

Warehouse is the reference model: the page reads its governed operational dataset
once and every presentation layer works from that same in-memory request snapshot.
FBM health therefore never performs an independent all-history MarketplaceOrder
scan.  No marketplace/provider calls or writes occur here.
