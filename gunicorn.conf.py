"""
Gunicorn configuration for the governed BT38 runtime.

The governed event queue is process-memory only, so HTTP requests and the
single runtime owner must share one process. Threaded concurrency keeps normal
page/API requests concurrent without creating a second process-local event
queue that the runtime cannot see.

Low-DB startup policy:
- app import must not start the historical broad runtime loop;
- after the worker/app is initialized, install the low-DB event loop and start
  the existing governed runtime owner;
- webhook/SQS events remain the immediate path;
- the only timed safety net is the bounded eBay missed-listing check: once at
  worker start and then at most every eight hours, newest Item IDs only, with
  existing MarketplaceListing Item IDs skipped before any import write.
